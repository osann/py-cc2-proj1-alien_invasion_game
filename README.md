# Alien Invasion Game
## Programmed by osann on GitHub

This tiny application was developed purely to help my learning path with Python.
The code was developed and followed along with Python Crash Course 2nd Edition's Project I chapter.
I more or less developed the application identically to what is shown in the book, with my spin on things however. 

### 2 Modes:
#### Alien invasion side scroller:
Simply aliens come from left to right, you must kill all before they reach the end.
Killing aliens gets you points, dying loses points.
Each wave gets harder.

#### Target practice:
A target practice variant with a moving target at the end of the screen.
Hit the target to score, each hit increases it's speed.
If you miss you lose points.

This is mostly just for reference later in my career.
